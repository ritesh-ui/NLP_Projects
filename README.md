FAKE NEWS CLASSIFIER

In the era of social media & hyper connected world, influence of fake news have been increasing day by day. And we all are aware of how dangerous this can be. Hence this motivated me to make a project which will help in identifying fake news.

The dataset that I have taken is from US election 2016.The dataset has around 80K records consisting of news title , news content and target.

Final project is deployed using heroku. Streamlit has been used to create the web application.

Deployed Model.
